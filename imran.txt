We will never compromise on corruption.
These corrupt leaders have destroyed Pakistan.
Our fight is for justice and equality.
The youth of this country is our real strength.
We will not bow before any external pressure.
The rulers of the past have looted the nation.
We will build a system based on merit and fairness.
Those who betrayed the people will be held accountable.
Our goal is a prosperous and self-reliant Pakistan.
I will continue this struggle no matter what challenges we face.
